# NoteMaster

## Introduction
NoteMaster is a simple and efficient web application designed to help users create, edit, delete, and manage notes effortlessly. This project focuses on testing the application's functionality, UI/UX, and data integrity to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Objectives
- Verify that users can create, edit, delete, and search for notes.
- Ensure the application maintains data integrity and security.
- Validate responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
- Identify and fix any functional and UI issues.
- Ensure a smooth user experience without critical bugs.

## Scope
### In Scope:
- User authentication (Signup, Login, Logout)
- Notes creation, editing, deletion, and search
- UI/UX consistency across different devices
- Error handling and validation messages
- Data persistence and retrieval

### Out of Scope:
- Performance/load testing
- Security penetration testing beyond basic validations

## Testable Features
- **User Authentication:** Signup, login, logout
- **Notes Management:** Creating, updating, deleting, and searching for notes
- **User Interface:** Responsive design, UI consistency
- **Error Handling:** Form validation, empty note handling, invalid input scenarios
- **Performance:** Page load time and responsiveness

## Testing Approach
### Manual Testing:
- Functional testing to verify core features.
- UI testing to ensure a consistent experience.
- Negative testing for handling invalid inputs.

### Automation Testing:
- Automate test cases using Selenium with Java and TestNG.
- Implement explicit waits for smooth execution.
- Execute smoke, sanity, and regression tests.
- Run automation scripts on different browsers using TestNG parallel execution.

### Compatibility Testing:
- Testing on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox).
- Devices: Windows 11.
